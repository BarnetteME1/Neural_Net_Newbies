Neural_Net_Newbies
==================

This repository holds code that will be used in my PyCon 2015 presentation.


Code samples for different Python packages that run Neural Networks.

Theano
--------

The MNIST example is from this [link](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/logreg.html) with some modifications especially around comments.

Data is located at this [link](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/deep/data/mnist/mnist.pkl.gz).

Additional tutorial at this [link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/craffel/theano-tutorial/blob/master/Theano%20Tutorial.ipynb).
